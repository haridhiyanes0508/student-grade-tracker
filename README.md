Student Grade Tracker
Problem Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a Student Grade Tracker program that allows a teacher to manage student grades efficiently. The program should enable the teacher to input the grades for each student, and based on this data, compute and display key statistics about the students' performance.

Functionality:
1.Input Student Grades:

The program should prompt the teacher to enter the number of students.

For each student, the program should allow the teacher to input their grade.

2.Compute Statistics:

Highest Score: The program should compute and display the highest grade among all the students.

Lowest Score: The program should compute and display the lowest grade among all the students.

Average Score: The program should compute and display the average score of all students.

3.Data Storage:

Grades should be stored dynamically using ArrayLists to accommodate any number of students.

4.Edge Case Handling:

The program should handle cases where no students are entered (i.e., zero students).

The grades inputted should be validated to ensure they are within a valid range (0 to 100).

Features:

ArrayList Usage: Used for storing student grades dynamically, making the program flexible and scalable.

Validation: Ensures that user inputs for grades are within a valid range (0 to 100).

Statistics Calculation: Automatically computes the highest, lowest, and average scores.

Technologies Used:

Java: The program is written in Java, utilizing basic data structures like ArrayList.

Scanner: Used for reading user input in a console-based interface.

How to Run:

1.Clone the repository.

2.Compile the Java file using javac Student.java.

3.Run the program using java Student.

4.Follow the prompts to input student grades and see the computed statistics.
